# RingZer0
Collect and build a Workspace for RingZer0 CTF files

Use /RingZer0/Rzer0-Tree.py First To Build The Directory Tree Out and Grab Challenge Htmls,
(^^) # This requires you to put your user and pass into the script so we can grab the */challenges/# correctly because it wants you to be logged in to view/scrape these but not the actual challenge files hence:

Then Use /RingZer0/Rzer0-Collect.py To Collect All The Challenge Files/pages
